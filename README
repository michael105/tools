Assorted tools.
Mainly perl.
Also a few modules I wrote, in the perl directory

preplace 
========
is possibly the most useful tool -
replace an occurance of a string with another string,
optionally ask for each occurance,
and show the result.


watchpid
========
Watch a pid or named process,
execute an argument when the process exits.
